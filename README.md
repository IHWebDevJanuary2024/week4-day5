# React lifting state up

In this lesson we've learned how to lift state up in React. We've seen how to pass state and functions as props to child components, and how to use them to update the state of the parent component.

If we have more than one component that needs to share the same state, we can lift the state up to the closest common ancestor of those components. This way, we can keep the state in sync between the components.
